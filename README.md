# Assignment on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)

## Question 1: 
## (a) Create a COBRAPY model for the reaction set shown in part (A) of Figure-1.pdf?
## (b) For the model, determine the maximum biomass flux for the environmental condition where (i) Carbon 1 is allowed at maximum uptake rate of 20 mM per gDW per hour, and O2 (Oxygen) is allowed at unconstrained levels, while other nutrients are not avaialble for uptake?  
## (c) For the model, determine the essential reactions for the environmental condition where (i) Carbon 1 is allowed at maximum uptake rate of 20 mM per gDW per hour, and O2 (Oxygen) is allowed at unconstrained levels, while other nutrients are not avaialble for uptake? An 'essential reaction' is one whose single knockout results in a modified system which cannot produce biomass flux.
## (d) For the model, determine the essential genes for the environmental condition where (i) Carbon 1 is allowed at maximum uptake rate of 20 mM per gDW per hour, and O2 (Oxygen) is allowed at unconstrained levels, while other nutrients are not avaialble for uptake? 
## (e) For the model, determine the set of synthetic lethal genes for the environmental condition where (i) Carbon 1 is allowed at maximum uptake rate of 20 mM per gDW per hour, and O2 (Oxygen) is allowed at unconstrained levels, while other nutrients are not avaialble for uptake? 

## Question 2: 
## (a) Read in the E. coli metabolic model iJO1366 into COBRAPY? You may download the SBML version of the metabolic model from the supplementary material of the manuscript: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261703/
## (b) For the model, determine the maximum biomass flux in a medium containing glucose in constrained amounts and oxygen in unconstrained amounts.   
## (c) For the model, determine the essential reactions in a medium containing glucose in constrained amounts and oxygen in unconstrained amounts.   
## (d) For the model, determine the essential genes in a medium containing glucose in constrained amounts and oxygen in unconstrained amounts.   
## (e) For the model, determine the set of synthetic lethal genes in a medium containing glucose in constrained amounts and oxygen in unconstrained amounts.
